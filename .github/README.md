Welcome to my little ToDo-Application projekt "TaskTogether"! The inital idea was that it can be used personal and in teams (thats the "together"-part). I only managed to do the first part, so its "just" a very basic todo-Application for personal use based on the RefArch (reference architecture) of it@M.

To learn more about the architecture itself, checkout its [documentation][refarch-documentation] or [code][refarch-code].

The templates are based on [Spring][spring-documentation] and [Vue.js][vuejs-documentation].
